# Dynamic Dashboards with Django and D3
## Clinton Dreisbach, RTI International

### Ideas

* Django ORM makes customized aggregations and expressions easy
    * Date truncation for more/less granularity
    * Percentiles
* django-url-filter takes GET params -> queryset filters
* Mike Bostock - blocks.org
* Reactive programming simplifies complex interactions
* django-webpack-loader

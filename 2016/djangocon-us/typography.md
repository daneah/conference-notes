### Typography is what language looks like

* Delightful, easy to read, utilitarian
* Evokes emotion
* Brand impression, decision making, motivation, personality, memories

### Legibility

* Size and line height
* Optimal font size: 14/15px - 24/25px
* Optimal line ehgith: 120-145%
* Bigger font size == bigger line height
* Mobile can be smaller

### White Space and Proximity

* Margins, padding, line height, negative space
* Guides user through the page
* Whitespace conveys relationships
* Vertical rhythm

### Hierarchy

* Organize elements by importance using size, proximity, repetition, color
* Group like elements
* Repetition/consistency allow for assumptions

### Emphasis

* Bold or italic, not underlined

### Pay attention to punctuation!

* Dashes
* Ellipses
* Quotes
* Hang punctuation over justification

### Pairing Typefaces

* Read your content and fit to match
* A single typeface typically won't do, but don't use more than two
* Weight contrast and mood contrast between fonts

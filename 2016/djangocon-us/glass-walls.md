# Breaking Down the Glass Walls of Tech
## Janice Levenhagen

### Ideas

* Even "small" barriers can stop you in your tracks
* As a teenager, you can go through life completely oblivious
    * What you know as a kid is mostly what the adults around you expose you to
    * If you don't know what to search for, you won't necessarily find new ideas
* Teenagers are easily swayed
* A sense of belonging is really important
* 56% of CS women leave in first 10 years

### Background

* Founder of ChickTech
    * Get and keep women and girls in high tech
* ACT-W - Advancing the careers of technical women

### Why isn't this fixed?

* A global societal issue that isn't technical
    * Women represent 53% of new hires down to only 5% of CEOs
* People still don't see it as an issue
    * 66% of men and 30% of women believe there are equal opportunities for women in tech
* People don't take responsibility for their part
    * Implicit bias test/training

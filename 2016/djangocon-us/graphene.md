# Graphene
## Syrus Akbary, Affirm

### Ideas

* graphene-python.org

### Dealing with REST

* API versioning
* Input/output validation
* Data under-/over-fetching
* Network errors + latency
* GraphQL can help with the last two points

### GraphQL

* query looks like JSON, response is JSON in same shape
* Query validation
* Strictly-typed input and output
* Introspection - client can see all available data

### Graphene

* GraphQL in Python
* Wide Python support
* Django 1.6+ support
* Creating queries similar to creating Django models
* Automatic mapping to Django models via class Meta

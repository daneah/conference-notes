## Reaching a wide audience

### Reassurances
* Learning is hard
* OK to have to practice
* "I had to learn this stuff too"

### Encourage breaks
* No one works well on empty stomach
* Blood flow helps the brain work
* Change of scenery for problem-solving

### Inclusion
* Use non-gendered pronouns
* Use diverse names
* Don't rely on idioms
* Slow down

### Embrace the y'all!
* Folks
* Everyone
* Friends & enemies
* Youse

### Mom gets things done!
Don't use parents or their gender as a negative

### Avoid four letter words
* Easy
* Just
* Only
* etc

### No techshaming!

### Avoid jargon and acronyms

### Make mistakes
* Error handling
* Log and stacktrace parsin
* Typos
* Refactoring


## Reinforcement

### Coding challenges
* Minimal and clear instructions
* Approach from different angles
* Repeat previous challenges as single steps in larger problems

### Better than before
* Measure outcomes instead of path to achieve them

### Repos and issues
* Provide code students can check out
* Have issues for them to solve (bugs, etc)
* `git tag` checkpoints

### Story problems
* Provide problems that use real-life, non-programming-specific situations

### Notes and documentation
* Take home guides
* Jupyter notebooks
* Project files

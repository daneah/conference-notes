## Rethinking production monitoring

84% of customers leave after 2 crashes
49% of engineering time is spent finding and fixing bugs

Complaints trickle down from customer service to engineers, _if at all_.
Customers often don't complain.
Checking the logs doesn't always work because logs must be explicitly introduced into the application.

Accept – Accept that things will break and things will be missed
Automate – Add hooks to detect crashes/errors/issues in production
Aggregate – Group like issues together rather than a stream of events
Notify – Alert teams where they already communicate. Alert based on smart thresholds.
Prioritize – Focus on the most harmful errors, as you can't fix everything.
Diagnose – Knowing about issues isn't enough. They must be actionable.
Tend – Act.


## Taking action

Tools:

* Use failure hooks
* Assess impact
* Assess severity
* Capture diagnostic data
* Use team chat
* Track progress of fixes

Create a "bug team"

# Every Company is a Software Company (Panel)

## How will software change core businesses in the next 3-5 years

GE: Data collection to optimize asset utilization. $6B software company GE Digital
Ford: Shift from mechanical engineering to electrical engineering, then to software. Car is network on wheels
Target: ???
John Deere: Analyzing collected data


## What are some of the biggest surprises?

Target: Surprises are rare. Focus was on optimizing supply chain and merchandising. Now guest focused – quick fulfillment.
John Deere: Techniques for management and process control for manufacturing and design of vehicles don't work well for software.
Ford: Need to keep two heads: provide safe vehicles but also move quickly with software.
GE: Factory automation worker needed to use an application with gloves and overalls on. Difficult use case. Asked about 20 year road maps when shooting for CI.


## Community

GE: Teams all colocated. Extreme Programming.
Ford: Develop apps in Palo Alto, scale in Pontiac, e.g.
Target: Thinking of building models as products. As you bring in people from other disciplines you need community.
John Deere: Not colocated. 200 people in US, 50 in Europe, 60 in India. Bringing all work together is a challenge. Campfire. Flowdoc.


## Giving developers permission

John Deere: Subversion historically. Mercurial was better, but GitHub was better because of social aspects. Big benefit from giving developers freer reign.
GE: Developers have power to choose languages and platforms based on need.
Ford: Freedom in Palo Alto because the leadership is in Michigan. Showcase outcomes and no one questions how they arrived.
Target: Changing mindset to take the initiative to build something and ask permission later. Open source and community.

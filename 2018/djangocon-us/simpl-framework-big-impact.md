# "Simpl framework, big impact!" by Joseph Lee and Jane Eisenstein

Wharton Learning Lab maintains a number of simulations they run thousands of times a year.
They wanted to build the Simpl framework to overcome the challenge of limited development resources for faster time-to-production.
Wharton generally builds games around these to educate on business topics.


## Simulations

* Web-based, multi-user applications based on mathematical models


## Framework benefits

* Don't need to start from scratch
* Design patterns are consistent and repeatable
* Keeps data in sync
* Democratizes access to the technology for other teams


## Simpl

Simpl provides modeling for all aspects of a simulation:

* Game
* Phase
* Role
* Run
* World
* RunUser
* Scenario
* Period
* Decision
* Result

There can be a massive amount of data, but Simpl can fetch subtrees of this that relevant only to the authenticated user.

# "The Automatic Computer and You: A Meditation Upon the History and Future of Software Development" by Glyph


## The purview of software

Software should be made enjoyable if it is intended for direct human consumption.
If it can't fully automate a task, it should minimally make executing that task enjoyable to those doing it.


## Ethics and responsibility

The narrative of nuclear energy is a great example where safety regulations placed on the nuclear infrastructure
would have been more effective than safety disasters causing government to impose regulations.
Fewer people would have been affected since disasters may not have happened,
and people in the industry would have clean hands.
Other examples of this from software are the Equifax data breach and the heartbleed bug.


## Longevity

Cathedrals take decades to build and last centuries.
What would software that takes 100 years to build look like?
Most software diverges toward more open bugs than fixed bugs, and is eventually abandoned.
The secret to longevity isn't the actual construction technique;
it's building a community around the project that wants the project to succeed.


## Community

We can only hope to solve large problems with a diverse set of input,
not just from different people but different industries.

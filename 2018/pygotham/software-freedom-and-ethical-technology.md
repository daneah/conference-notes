# "Software Freedom and Ethical Technology" by Karen M. Sandler

## I have a big heart

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy means their heart is literally three times bigger than average.
Offered an implant defibrillator.

This raised the question, "What does it run?"
Algorithms determine how the device operates.
Having something implanted in your body operating on proprietary software is harrowing.

The defibrillator can shock pregnant women, who have heart palpitations naturally about 25% of the time.
The only solution was to take drugs to slow down the heart.
Most defibrillators are given to people over the age of 65, where pregnancy is rare.
Use cases govern solutions, which can lead to major issues for outliers.


## Defects and vulnerabilities

There is generally one defect per hundred lines of code.
A premium-class vehicle has about 100 million lines of code,
which could translate to as many as 1 million defects!
Open source allows more people to review the code and find issues.

The honeymoon effect of vulnerabilities means more issues are found more quickly over time.


## Autonomy

Autonomy is a major value proposition for transparency.
Many terms of agreement are so long they could take days, weeks, or months to review.
They reference other agreements which reference other agreements,
which are nearly impossible to review and follow strictly.

Open software allows people to contribute solutions and fixes
or extend/change the implement to suit their use case.
Proprietary software is inflexible and often bureaucratic so solutions aren't implemented often or quickly.
We have more free software than ever, but less actual freedom in technology than ever.


## Future-proofing

Software is being built into products that can last decades.
We don't know what the world will look like ten or twenty years from now;
open software means it can change with the times.
Open software implies and supports the idea that no one and nothing is perfect.
Democratizing software helps us all improve together.


## Security vs. privacy

Defibrillators and other equipment often broadcast unencrypted information.
Few devices allow turning off the wireless broadcasting.
We're only as safe as our weakest device since the internet of things means everything talks to everything.
Vulnerabilities are often exploited through systems that didn't have security in mind.
Mass failures may be the only impetus to fix the connectedness frenzy.


## Major takeaways

* Think about ethical implications when developing or using software
* Speak up about issues or making non-mission-critical software open
* Choose copyleft
* Negotiate employment to make sure working on open source or keeping your copyrights is in writing
* Organize
* You have more power than you think!

# "What if Jane Austen had been an Engineer?" by Lacey Williams Henschel

## Planning

* Outlining before writing code to get a big picture idea of what it will look like
* Choose an organizational structure that reflects either the business domain or the functionality encapsulated within
* Write one thing at a time


## Plot

1. Exposition
1. Rising action
1. Climax
1. Falling action
1. Denouement


## Reading and writing

We are all reading and writing, but we're reading what others wrote and writing what others will read.


## Where we go from here

Fewer people becoming programmers out of humanities fields,
more people becoming digital humanities experts.
